# cash-cockpit
### Description

CashCockpit is an app which allows users to get a better overview of their spendings. It allows to categorize every outcome and income, as well as set goals, bank accounts and so-called AutoPays. AutoPays are simple bills which get added every week, month or year. It also provides detailed statistics of bank accounts bills, categories and goals. When it comes to saving data, the user can choose whether everything should be kept locally or saved on the cloud. This allows synchronization between devices. All the backend is done using Google Firebase as well as the Authentication. CashCockpit was built by me nearly two years ago. It might not have the best architecture and never got released, however, it was a great learning opportunity for me during the one year long development time.
